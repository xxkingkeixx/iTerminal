Suko was created by idealists who believe that the essential nature of all human beings is to be kind, considerate, helpful, intelligent, responsible, and respectful of others.
This doesn’t mean that everyone always acts this way. Therefore, we’ve created a list of simple rules that you need to follow when you use Suko. If you don’t follow the rules, you risk being kicked off Suko and banned.
The Rules:
Don’t threaten people.

This includes threats of violence, and threats to hurt others in any way.
Don’t post others’ personal information.

Don’t post any personal information of any other users or third parties unless you have express permission from them to do so.
Don’t hate.

Slurs or hate speech, including denigrating comments involving race, sexual orientation, religious or political belief, age, or just about anything else, whether they be personal or general, besides being very uncool, are not allowed.
Don’t promote self-harm.

Do not post content that glorifies self-harm. Do not encourage others to harm themselves. Suko is a safe space to support recovery.
Don’t spam.

Don’t use fake tags or deceptive links or try to mislead others about the things you post. Don’t use malware or other evil code when you post. Don’t use Suko as a vehicle for generating revenue for affiliate marketing. No phishing. Don’t follow massive amounts of users for the sole purpose of leading them to your profile. When you follow someone, they are sent an e-mail notification, and thus following too many users is considered spam.
Don’t automate.

Suko is for human beings. It is against the rules to use a computer to register a lot of users on Suko, or to follow lots of users, or to automate posting.
Don’t infringe on other people’s copyrights and trademarks.

Don’t post content that belongs to third parties without their consent. Please make sure you have the right to post the content that you put on Suko. In other words, only post content that you own or have permission to post.
Be legal.

Only post content that is legal, meaning you can’t post content that violates a law, rule or regulation.
Don’t squat on usernames.

Don’t register a username that you are not going to use yourself. Don’t sell your username. Don’t register a username just to prevent someone else from using it. Usernames that have not been actively used for an extended period will be reclaimed.
Don’t impersonate others.

Be yourself, or a version of yourself. Please don’t pretend to be someone else.
Don’t hurt young people.

Don’t post anything inappropriate about minors, including things that are violent or sexual in nature.
Don’t use Suko to intrude on other people’s privacy.

There’s enough of that going on by big internet and governments around the world.
