The Terms are a contract between you and Ello, PBC (“Ello”, “us”, “we”), which is applicable when you use our web sites (including www.ello.co), services, mobile applications, products, and content provided by Ello, globally, in existence now or in the future, forever and ever (“Ello Services” or “Service”).","","By accessing or using the Ello Services (whether or not you create a member account), you agree to be bound to the Terms. That means that if you don’t agree to these Terms, please don’t use the Ello Services. Additionally, you must abide by our Rules, which are found here: [link to Rules], and are incorporated into the Terms. Please read the Rules, which include important rules and guidelines governing the behavior we expect of Ello Services users, as well as the actions we may take if you do not follow the Rules.","","Ello may update these Terms from time to time. We will let you know if we make significant changes by sending a notice to the email address connected with your Ello Services account, or by placing a notice in a prominent place on our web site. If we make a significant change, the notice we provide will indicate when the change will be effective. If you do not agree with the upcoming change, please delete your account. If you continue to use the Ello Services after the stated effective date, you will be deemed to have accepted the change.","","To be eligible to use the Ello Services, you must be at least 13 years old, you must be old enough to enter into a contract with Ello, and you must have a valid email address. You must create an account to post content on the Ello Services and to access other features offered only to account holders. We require an email address, password and a username, which may or may not be your real name.","","You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Services and for any activities or actions under your password. Ello cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above.","","You must provide an email address that is actually yours. When you sign up to become an Ello Services member, you will also be asked to choose a username and a password. Usernames are allocated on a first come, first serve basis. Ello reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to (a) refuse to issue a particular username, or (b) remove or reclaim any username. For instance, we may refuse to issue a username or reclaim a username if a third party that owns a trademark complains that a username violates that third party’s intellectual property rights, or if we determine that such user name impersonates someone else, misappropriates a person’s right of publicity, is illegal, or offensive. Your username is how you will be publicly identified, along with any photo you associate with your account.","","You Have Choices","","While Ello is constantly evolving and we expect new features, functions and settings to be introduced regularly, you can always go to “Settings” to customize your Ello Services experience. For instance, you can choose whether your profile is publicly accessible outside of the Ello Services and whether to allow other users to comment on your posts.","","Soon, we will provide more settings, such as the ability to designate your Ello Services profile as “Not Suitable for Work,” or NSFW, which we’d like you to do if you will or may have sexually explicit content.","","When You Post on the Ello Services","","We don’t claim ownership over any Content that you post on the Ello Services. “Content” means any content or creative expression that you’re able to upload or post on the Ello Services, including text, images, files, animations, logos, comments, or otherwise. However, when you post or transfer Content to the Ello Services, you give us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, world-wide, perpetual, transferable license to use, store, reproduce, adapt (so we can properly post your Content), distribute and publicly display your Content in order to provide the Ello Services.","","You are responsible for the Content you submit to the Ello Services. You assume all risks associated with it, including accuracy, intellectual property claims, or any other legal rights claims. You represent and warrant that (i) you either own the Content you post, or that you have all necessary rights to post that Content on the Ello Services, (ii) your Content does not infringe any third party’s rights, and (iii) you can grant the licenses you grant in these Terms.","","When you post on the Ello Services, you are agreeing to allow other Ello Services members and members of the public (unless you set your Settings to prevent public display) to view, distribute and display your Content. Consider the Content you post on the Ello Services to be publicly available indefinitely since it may be distributed by other Ello Services members through social media or otherwise, or be cached on third party search engines, even after your Ello Services account is terminated. Be aware that it is extremely difficult to remove content from the Internet that becomes publicly available.","","We reserve the right (though we have no obligation) to refuse or remove any Content you post or transfer to the Ello Services for any reason.","","You understand that when using the Ello Services, you may be exposed to content from a variety of sources, and that Ello is not responsible for the accuracy, usefulness, safety, or intellectual property rights of, or relating to, such content. You may be exposed to content that are inaccurate, offensive, indecent, sexually explicit and other adult oriented content, or objectionable, and you agree to waive, and hereby do waive, any legal or equitable rights or remedies you may have against Ello with respect thereto. If you do not wish to see sexually explicit content, please go to your Settings and choose the NSFW option indicating you do not want to see sexually explicit material. While we cannot guarantee that you won’t see sexually explicit material if you choose not to, we will try to prevent it from happening.","","Unless requested by law enforcement or the government, Ello will never sell, distribute or share your Content outside of the Ello Services without your permission. However, as mentioned above, other Ello Services users may distribute and share your Content outside of the Ello Services.","","At any time, you may delete your Content from the Ello Services, or delete your account in your account “Settings.” Additionally, we reserve the right to terminate or suspend your account at any time, with or without notice. When your account is terminated, you no longer have the right to access or use the Ello Services. When you delete Content or your account is terminated, we will use reasonable efforts to remove all of your Content from the Ello Services. However, there may be a delay between your request and when the Content or account is publicly visible due to technical or operational limitations. Note that we do retain backups of Content on our servers, and some of your Content may remain on our servers (though not publicly visible) even after you ask to have it deleted. If you delete your account or Content, it may be permanently unrecoverable.","","We may modify our Services at any time, since the Ello Services are a constantly changing and evolving service. We may delete or modify any part or all of this Service at any time, without notice. We may add features and functionality from time to time, and we reserve the right to limit use of certain features or functions.","","We may modify or adapt your Content in order to transmit, display or distribute it over computer networks and in various media and/or make changes to your Content as are necessary to conform and adapt that Content to any requirements or limitations of any networks, devices, services or media.","","User Activity","","If you haven’t uploaded a profile picture or header image within 60 days of creating your account, we may remove your account and allow another user to select your username. We may send you a warning e-mail before doing so.","","Also, if you haven’t logged into your account for 365 days, we may delete your account to make room for new users. Again, we will send you a warning e-mail to let you know that your account is about to be removed, giving you a chance to log in and keep your account.","","If you use a robot to post on the Ello Services, or to sign up for multiple accounts, or to follow lots of other users, we may delete your account. If you follow too many other users we may delete your account if we feel you are not acting like a human being.","","Links","","The Services may contain links to third-party websites or resources. You acknowledge and agree that the Ello Entities are not responsible or liable for: (i) the availability or accuracy of such websites or resources; or (ii) the content, products, or services on or available from such websites or resources. Links to such websites or resources do not imply any endorsement by the Ello Entities of such websites or resources or the content, products, or services available from such websites or resources. You acknowledge sole responsibility for and assume all risk arising from your use of any such websites or resources.","","Property We Own and Restrictions","","Ello, PBC. owns all rights to our logo, the Ello Services, and our website, including any intellectual property rights related to them. You may not reuse, distribute, copy, or duplicate any part of the Service, including the Ello HTML/CSS, JavaScipt, logos, or visual design elements without express written permission from Ello.","","Content You Post","","Privacy","","When you use the Ello Services, you agree to the Ello Privacy Policy, which is incorporated into these Terms. Please read the Privacy Policy because it describes what information and data we collect and how we use it.","","Paid Services","","Ello may offer some features or functionality for a fee. Fees are stated in US dollars, and you’ll be responsible for any applicable sales taxes or other charges arising from the transaction. Even though you’re paying for a feature or functionality, you don’t own it – you’re purchasing the right to use or access that feature or functionality. Fees are non-refundable. Ello may charge fees at any time in its discretion. We will not collect credit card numbers – instead, we will use a trusted third party credit card or payment processor.","","No Children Under 13","","You need to be 13 years or older to use the Ello Services. If you’re under 13, please don’t use the Ello Services. If we learn that you or anyone else is under 13 and is using the Ello Services, we’ll close the child’s account.","","Security and Responsible Disclosures","","We do our best to protect our service from security vulnerabilities, and to make the Ello Services better. You can read about this in our Security Policy.","","Ello’s Rules","","Ello has rules that all users must follow. You can find them here.","","DMCA Copyright Policy","","Ello complies with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”). We will terminate copyright infringers when legally required or appropriate.","","If you see your Content on Ello being used without your permission, you can contact Ello’s Designated Agent for receipt of infringement notices here:","","Ello PBC, 688 Pine Street, Suite 2A, Burlington, VT 05401, by calling 802.557.0571 or by emailing legal@ello.co.","","Your notice must comply with the DMCA. For your request to be valid under the DMCA, you must provide the following information in writing: (a) An electronic or physical signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner; (b) Identification of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed; (c) Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing and where it is located on the Service; (d) Information reasonably sufficient to permit Company to contact you, such as your address, telephone number, and, e-mail address; (e) A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or law; and (f) A statement, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information is accurate, and that you are the copyright owner or are authorized to act on behalf of the owner.","","Other Stuff Our Lawyers Made Us Put In","","You acknowledge and agree that Ello’s servers and operations are in the United States. As a result, regardless of where you live, your Content is transferred to and stored in the United States, and you hereby consent to the transfer, processing, and storage of your Content in the United States.","","Use Restrictions. The rights granted to you in these terms are subject to the following restrictions: (a) you shall not license, sell, rent, lease, transfer, assign, distribute, host or otherwise commercially exploit the Service, whether in whole or in part, or any content displayed on the Service, (b) you shall not modify, make derivative works of, disassemble, reverse compile or reverse engineer any part of the Service, (c) you shall not access the Service in order to build a similar or competitive website or service, and (d) except as expressly stated herein, no part of the Service may be copied, reproduced, distributed, republished, downloaded, displayed, posted or transmitted in any form by any means.","","No Warranty.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, ELLO, ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AND ITS LICENSORS DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE OR CONTENT ON THE SERVICE IS ACCURATE, RELIABLE OR CORRECT; THAT THE SERVICE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS; THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE AVAILABLE AT ANY PARTICULAR TIME OR LOCATION, UNINTERRUPTED OR SECURE; THAT ANY DEFECTS OR ERRORS WILL BE CORRECTED; OR THAT THE SERVICE IS FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. These limitations may not apply if the jurisdiction in which you reside does not allow these exclusions.","","You understand that Ello is not responsible or liable for, and you hereby release Ello, to the fullest extent allowed by applicable law from: (a) your interactions or disputes you have with other Ello Services members, whether those interactions are through the Ello Services or in the real, physical world, (b) your own acts and omissions, and (c) your Content. If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code § 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”","","Limitation of Liability. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL ELLO, ITS AFFILIATES, AGENTS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, THAT RESULT FROM THE USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THIS SERVICE. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ELLO ASSUMES NO LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY (I) ERRORS, MISTAKES, OR INACCURACIES OF CONTENT; (II) PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE, OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER, RESULTING FROM YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OUR SERVICE; (III) ANY UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR USE OF OUR SECURE SERVERS AND/OR ANY AND ALL PERSONAL INFORMATION STORED THEREIN; (IV) ANY INTERRUPTION OR CESSATION OF TRANSMISSION TO OR FROM THE SERVICE; (V) ANY BUGS, VIRUSES, TROJAN HORSES, OR THE LIKE THAT MAY BE TRANSMITTED TO OR THROUGH OUR SERVICE BY ANY THIRD PARTY; (VI) ANY ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN ANY CONTENT OR FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE USE OF ANY CONTENT POSTED, EMAILED, TRANSMITTED, OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE; AND/OR (VII) USER SUBMISSIONS OR THE DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE, OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF ANY THIRD PARTY. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED HEREIN, ELLO’S LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE (FOR ANY CAUSE WHATSOEVER AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF THE ACTION), WILL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF (A) $100 OR (B) TOTAL FEES PAID BY YOU TO ELLO DURING THE SIX (6) MONTHS PRIOR TO THE TIME SUCH CLAIM AROSE.","","Entire Terms. These terms and the rest of our legal terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the use of the service. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. These terms, and your rights and obligations herein, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without Ello’s prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void. Ello may assign the Terms at any time without restriction. The terms and conditions set forth in these terms shall be binding upon assignees.","","These terms shall be governed by the laws of the state of Vermont without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that may require the application of the law of another jurisdiction. If you believe that Ello has not adhered to these terms, please contact Ello by e-mail at legal@ello.co. We will do our best to address your concerns. If you feel that your complaint has been addressed incompletely, we invite you to let us know for further investigation. If you and Ello are unable to reach a resolution to the dispute, you and Ello will settle the dispute exclusively under the rules of the American Arbitration Association (www.adr.org) in Burlington, Vermont. Any election to arbitrate by one party will be final and binding on the other. You understand that if either party elects to arbitrate, neither party will have the right to sue in court or have a jury trial. You and Ello agree that any arbitration will be limited to the dispute between Ello and you individually. You acknowledge and agree that you and Ello are each waiving the right to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and Ello otherwise agree, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding.","","Copyright & Trademark Information","","Copyright © 2015, Ello, PBC, All rights reserved.

These terms and the rest of our legal terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the use of the service.

The Terms are a contract between you and Suko,  (“Suko”, “us”, “we”), which is applicable when you use our web sites (including www.suko.tv), services, mobile applications, products, and content provided by Suko, globally, in existence now or in the future, forever and ever (“Suko Services” or “Service”).","By accessing or using the Suko Services (whether or not you create a member account), you agree to be bound to the Terms. That means that if you don’t agree to these Terms, please don’t use the Suko Services. Additionally, you must abide by our Rules, which are found here: [link to Rules], and are incorporated into the Terms. Please read the Rules, which include important rules and guidelines governing the behavior we expect of Suko Services users, as well as the actions we may take if you do not follow the Rules.","Suko may update these Terms from time to time. We will let you know if we make significant changes by sending a notice to the email address connected with your Suko Services account, or by placing a notice in a prominent place on our web site. If we make a significant change, the notice we provide will indicate when the change will be effective. If you do not agree with the upcoming change, please delete your account. If you continue to use the Suko Services after the stated effective date, you will be deemed to have accepted the change.","To be eligible to use the Suko Services, you must be at least 13 years old, you must be old enough to enter into a contract with Suko, and you must have a valid email address. You must create an account to post content on the Suko Services and to access other features offered only to account holders. We require an email address, password and a username, which may or may not be your real name.","You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Services and for any activities or actions under your password. Suko cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above.","You must provide an email address that is actually yours. When you sign up to become an Suko Services member, you will also be asked to choose a username and a password. Usernames are allocated on a first come, first serve basis. Suko reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to (a) refuse to issue a particular username, or (b) remove or reclaim any username. For instance, we may refuse to issue a username or reclaim a username if a third party that owns a trademark complains that a username violates that third party’s intellectual property rights, or if we determine that such user name impersonates someone else, misappropriates a person’s right of publicity, is illegal, or offensive. Your username is how you will be publicly identified, along with any photo you associate with your account.","You Have Choices","While Suko is constantly evolving and we expect new features, functions and settings to be introduced regularly, you can always go to “Settings” to customize your Suko Services experience. For instance, you can choose whether your profile is publicly accessible outside of the Suko Services and whether to allow other users to comment on your posts.","Soon, we will provide more settings, such as the ability to designate your Suko Services profile as “Not Suitable for Work,” or NSFW, which we’d like you to do if you will or may have sexually explicit content.","When You Post on the Suko Services","We don’t claim ownership over any Content that you post on the Suko Services. “Content” means any content or creative expression that you’re able to upload or post on the Suko Services, including text, images, files, animations, logos, comments, or otherwise. However, when you post or transfer Content to the Suko Services, you give us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, world-wide, perpetual, transferable license to use, store, reproduce, adapt (so we can properly post your Content), distribute and publicly display your Content in order to provide the Suko Services.","You are responsible for the Content you submit to the Suko Services. You assume all risks associated with it, including accuracy, intellectual property claims, or any other legal rights claims. You represent and warrant that (i) you either own the Content you post, or that you have all necessary rights to post that Content on the Suko Services, (ii) your Content does not infringe any third party’s rights, and (iii) you can grant the licenses you grant in these Terms.","When you post on the Suko Services, you are agreeing to allow other Suko Services members and members of the public (unless you set your Settings to prevent public display) to view, distribute and display your Content. Consider the Content you post on the Suko Services to be publicly available indefinitely since it may be distributed by other Suko Services members through social media or otherwise, or be cached on third party search engines, even after your Suko Services account is terminated. Be aware that it is extremely difficult to remove content from the Internet that becomes publicly available.","We reserve the right (though we have no obligation) to refuse or remove any Content you post or transfer to the Suko Services for any reason.","You understand that when using the Suko Services, you may be exposed to content from a variety of sources, and that Suko is not responsible for the accuracy, usefulness, safety, or intellectual property rights of, or relating to, such content. You may be exposed to content that are inaccurate, offensive, indecent, sexually explicit and other adult oriented content, or objectionable, and you agree to waive, and hereby do waive, any legal or equitable rights or remedies you may have against Suko with respect thereto. If you do not wish to see sexually explicit content, please go to your Settings and choose the NSFW option indicating you do not want to see sexually explicit material. While we cannot guarantee that you won’t see sexually explicit material if you choose not to, we will try to prevent it from happening.","Unless requested by law enforcement or the government, Suko will never sell, distribute or share your Content outside of the Suko Services without your permission. However, as mentioned above, other Suko Services users may distribute and share your Content outside of the Suko Services.","At any time, you may delete your Content from the Suko Services, or delete your account in your account “Settings.” Additionally, we reserve the right to terminate or suspend your account at any time, with or without notice. When your account is terminated, you no longer have the right to access or use the Suko Services. When you delete Content or your account is terminated, we will use reasonable efforts to remove all of your Content from the Suko Services. However, there may be a delay between your request and when the Content or account is publicly visible due to technical or operational limitations. Note that we do retain backups of Content on our servers, and some of your Content may remain on our servers (though not publicly visible) even after you ask to have it deleted. If you delete your account or Content, it may be permanently unrecoverable.","We may modify our Services at any time, since the Suko Services are a constantly changing and evolving service. We may delete or modify any part or all of this Service at any time, without notice. We may add features and functionality from time to time, and we reserve the right to limit use of certain features or functions.","We may modify or adapt your Content in order to transmit, display or distribute it over computer networks and in various media and/or make changes to your Content as are necessary to conform and adapt that Content to any requirements or limitations of any networks, devices, services or media.","User Activity","If you haven’t uploaded a profile picture or header image within 60 days of creating your account, we may remove your account and allow another user to select your username. We may send you a warning e-mail before doing so.","Also, if you haven’t logged into your account for 365 days, we may delete your account to make room for new users. Again, we will send you a warning e-mail to let you know that your account is about to be removed, giving you a chance to log in and keep your account.","If you use a robot to post on the Suko Services, or to sign up for multiple accounts, or to follow lots of other users, we may delete your account. If you follow too many other users we may delete your account if we feel you are not acting like a human being.","Links","The Services may contain links to third-party websites or resources. You acknowledge and agree that the Suko Entities are not responsible or liable for: (i) the availability or accuracy of such websites or resources; or (ii) the content, products, or services on or available from such websites or resources. Links to such websites or resources do not imply any endorsement by the Suko Entities of such websites or resources or the content, products, or services available from such websites or resources. You acknowledge sole responsibility for and assume all risk arising from your use of any such websites or resources.","Property We Own and Restrictions","Suko, . owns all rights to our logo, the Suko Services, and our website, including any intellectual property rights related to them. You may not reuse, distribute, copy, or duplicate any part of the Service, including the Suko HTML/CSS, JavaScipt, logos, or visual design elements without express written permission from Suko.","Content You Post","Privacy","When you use the Suko Services, you agree to the Suko Privacy Policy, which is incorporated into these Terms. Please read the Privacy Policy because it describes what information and data we collect and how we use it.","Paid Services","Suko may offer some features or functionality for a fee. Fees are stated in US dollars, and you’ll be responsible for any applicable sales taxes or other charges arising from the transaction. Even though you’re paying for a feature or functionality, you don’t own it – you’re purchasing the right to use or access that feature or functionality. Fees are non-refundable. Suko may charge fees at any time in its discretion. We will not collect credit card numbers – instead, we will use a trusted third party credit card or payment processor.","No Children Under 13","You need to be 13 years or older to use the Suko Services. If you’re under 13, please don’t use the Suko Services. If we learn that you or anyone else is under 13 and is using the Suko Services, we’ll close the child’s account.","Security and Responsible Disclosures","We do our best to protect our service from security vulnerabilities, and to make the Suko Services better. You can read about this in our Security Policy.","Suko’s Rules","Suko has rules that all users must follow.
